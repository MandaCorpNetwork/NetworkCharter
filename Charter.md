## Articles
> The following is the collection of Articles that define the Supremacy-Law of the Network.

### ARTICLE I: ESTABLISHMENT

The Unnamed Network is established to create a secure, collaborative, and mutually beneficial community of player-run organizations across Star Citizen. Our core objectives are to:
1. **Promote collective security** – Provide a mutual defense against external threats, promote coordinated operations in the event of war, provide timely assistance in the face of adversity, and develop a collective pool of resources and assets to be used to provide disaster relief.
2. **Foster economic prosperity** – Enable free, fair, and mutually beneficial trade, build economic relationships and partnerships, promote resource sharing, and develop joint infrastructure projects.
3. **Community Growth** – Build a larger community welcoming to new and old players alike, provide training and new gameplay opportunities, and build a network of orgs where any player can find their home.

### ARTICLE II: ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 **Network Council** – The Network shall be administered by a council consisting of a single representative from each Member Org.
* **Fleet Admirals** - Member Orgs shall be represented by a single Fleet Admiral, appointed by the respective Member Org. This Fleet Admiral may be the leader of the Org, or an ambassador specifically appointed to represent their Org.
  * Orgs shall appoint their Fleet Admirals as they see fit, however, Fleet Admirals shall be the primary voice for their Org in Council meetings and decisions, and shall hold authority within their Org to make binding agreements on behalf of their Org.
  * In the face of major decisions, deliberation by Fleet Admirals with the Org they represent is encouraged, and Fleet Admirals are encouraged to defer to their internal Org decision making processes to ensure they are accurately representing the interests, intentions, and will of their Org.
  * **Fleet Admiral Recusal** - A Fleet Admiral must recuse themselves from any vote or deliberation where they have a direct conflict of interest, such as matters involving their own Org's misconduct, personal disputes, or where their impartiality could reasonably be questioned. In such cases, the Member Org may appoint a temporary alternate representative.
* **Equal Representation** - All Fleet Admirals shall have equal status.
  * A Council Chair shall be appointed strictly to facilitate the administration of Council meetings, and shall have no greater authority or weight over any other Fleet Admiral.
  * The Chair shall be appointed at the beginning of every meeting on a rotating basis in order of Org membership, unless the meeting topic is specifically related to the Org that it falls upon or if the Fleet Admiral for that meeting is absent at role call. In the event of a shared Network membership date (as with the Founding Members), the rotation order shall be in alphabetical order of the Org names.
* **Player Votes** - The Network Council may, at their discretion, defer decisions of significant magnitude to a Network-wide vote of all users of a specified Network Rank, and Network ranks above the specified rank.
* **Veto Vote** - Each Member has a single Veto vote that may be cast to block any single vote by the Network Council, terminating the vote with a No result.
  * Items terminated by a Veto vote shall not be brought back to the floor for consideration during that session except by a super majority vote by all members of the Council.
  * Once a Member has utilized their Veto vote, it shall be considered expended until it refreshes once per six(6) months.
* **Council Resolutions** - The Network Council may establish additional policies, guidelines, processes, rules, regulations, appointments, or proceedings as deemed necessary by the Council by passing a Council Resolution.
  * These Resolutions shall carry the force of law within The Network.
  * These Resolutions shall not conflict with any stipulations, requirements, limitations, or other considerations set forth within the Charter. In any cases of conflict, the Charter shall have precedence.
  * Resolutions shall be passed by straight majority vote.
* **Charter Amendments** - Amendments to the Charter may be made by Council Resolution, but only with a three-quarters majority vote.
  
2.2 **Network Org Membership** – Each Network Member shall be a player-run Org in Star Citizen. Continued Membership in The Network is voluntary, and Members who join may elect to leave if they feel it is no longer in their Orgs’ interests.
  * **Induction into The Network** - Approval of new Member Orgs being sponsored to join The Network shall be done by a three-fifths vote of the Network Council, after consideration of their sponsorship.
    * Prospective Member Orgs must be sponsored by an existing Member of The Network.
    * Sponsors shall present the Prospective Member’s application to the Network Council and make the argument to accept their application.
    * Votes to accept an application will be nominated by the Sponsor, and require another Network Member to second the nomination to proceed to a full vote.
  * **Org Misconduct** - Member Orgs agree to operate in a manner that does not violate CIG’s ToS, EULA, or any Real Life laws, and behave publicly in a manner that does not bring discredit or undue hazard upon The Network as a whole, or any other Member Org of The Network. Significant misconduct can result in censure of the offending Member Org(s), which can range from a formal warning to suspension of Network services, and severe cases can result in ejection of the Member Org(s) from The Network.
    * Racist, sexist, or any other discriminatory actions, behaviors, or statements are forbidden, and may be grounds for censure or ejection from The Network.
      * Individual players in Member Orgs are free to have their personal opinions and beliefs and express their opinions and beliefs in private conversation, but that conversation should not express hostility towards other players in The Network, and players are encouraged to keep divisive opinions to themselves.

    * Violation or the promotion of the violation of Real Life laws in the context of the game or by the use of Network tools, social networks, etc. may be grounds for ejection from The Network.
    * Actions that bring public discredit, shame, or embarrassment upon The Network may be grounds for censure or ejection from The Network.

    * Member Org(s) will not act against the interests and ventures of other Member Org(s), disrupt Network events, and will not take in-game or player-generated contracts against Network Orgs or players. Significant and/or repeated offenses may be grounds for censure or ejection from The Network.
  * **Conflict Resolution** - In cases of conflict or dispute between two or more Network Member(s), where the conflict cannot be resolved at the Org level, Dispute Proceedings may be initiated by any Member Org of The Network.
    * At the time the Dispute Proceedings are initiated, the Council will determine if the dispute requires the full attention of the Council, or if another Member representative (either a Fleet Admiral or other player in a disinterested Member Org) may be appointed to adjudicate the dispute.
    * Either the Council or the appointed Adjudicator will listen to all sides of the conflict, and make their best attempt to determine the root issue at hand.
    * After hearing and evaluating all concerns, the Council or the Adjudicator will decide on how to resolve the conflict in a manner that is as fair and just, and least disruptive as possible. This decision will be binding on all applicable parties.
      *  For smaller disputes, the Adjudicator may be granted authority by the Council make the decision themselves.
      * For larger disputes, the Adjudicator will be directed to make a recommendation to the Council, and the Council will make their decision by Council Resolution.

    * The Member initiating the Ejection Proceedings shall present their case for the ejection of the specified Member Org, and must present compelling justification.
    * Seconding Members may also provide supporting justification during this time.
    * The Member Org elected to be ejected shall be given time to argue their defense.
    * Each Member of the Council will be granted time to question all parties involved.
    * After questioning, each Member of the Council will be granted time to make their final arguments in support of or opposition to the ejection.
    * After all arguments and questions are heard, the Council shall make deliberate, followed by a vote requiring straight majority.
    * If the Ejection vote fails, the Member who initiated the Ejection Proceedings shall be barred from initiating Ejection Proceedings against the specified Member Org for a period of six months, and any other Member for a period of two months.
  * **Player Bans** - Any Member Org reserves the right to ban an individual player from their Org, which will trigger the player to be suspended from all Network services pending review. If a three-fifths vote occurs by the Network Council to ban the player from The Network, that player will be banned from all Member Orgs and Network services.
    
2.3 **Network Hub** – The Network Hub is a specialized Member Org that serves as the central administrative and operational entity for The Network, managing shared resources and facilitating coordination among Member Orgs.
  * **Purpose and Structure** - The Network Hub forgoes the structure of an ordinary Org and operates solely as a centralized service Org. It manages all shared assets, services, and serves as the single point-of-truth for The Network, including but not limited to communication channels, shared databases, event calendars, and resource allocation systems.
  * **Selection and Change** - The initial Network Hub shall be designated by the Founding Members or by unanimous decision of the Network Council. The Hub can only be changed or replaced by a unanimous Council decision, ensuring stability and continuity in Network operations.
  * **Permissions & Governance** - Within the Network Hub, it's Officers & Leadership shall be responsibilities given to the Officer Corps & Admiral Council.
  * **Certified Membership** - Users may elect to join the Network Hub as their Primary Org and gain Certified Membership from it.

    * No formal Rank structure beyond Certified Org Members, Moderators, & Leadership (Administrators).
    * Org Ownership may exist as an individual or group.
      * The Fleet Admiral of the Hub Organization must be chosen from the Owners or Leadership of the Hub Organization.
      * The Fleet Admiral of the Hub Organization must have the Hub Organization as their Primary Org.
  * **Board of Directors** - The Network Hub will maintain a Board of Directors responsible for overseeing/assisting in coordinating Network-wide events, goals, aid distribution, and gameplay-related directives.

    * Only leadership members from Member Orgs are eligible to occupy Director positions, promoting representation and expertise from across The Network.
    * The Board shall report to the Network Council and may propose resolutions for Council approval, but it holds no independent voting authority outside of Hub-specific operations.
  * **Operations and Responsibilities** - The Network Hub shall handle day-to-day administrative tasks, such as maintaining Network-wide tools, facilitating inter-Org communications, and ensuring compliance with Charter provisions in shared activities.
    * The Hub may appoint internal staff or subcommittees as needed, subject to oversight by the Board of Directors.
    * All Hub decisions affecting The Network as a whole must be approved by the Network Council or align with existing Council Resolutions.
  * **Accountability** - The Network Hub is accountable to the Network Council. Any misconduct or inefficiency by the Hub may trigger review proceedings similar to Org Misconduct, potentially leading to censure or replacement via unanimous vote.
    
### ARTICLE III: NETWORK COMMITMENTS

3.1. **Collective Security and Aid**
  * **Mutual Defense** - Members will commit to the defense of all Network Members against hostile groups, and commit to supporting combat and wartime efforts in Network-sanctioned conflicts.
    * An attack on one is an attack on all. Any outside entity that initiates hostilities against any Member of The Network will be initiating hostilities against the entire Network. Network Members will dedicate every reasonable effort to protect each other in the event of an outside attack, and neutralize the threat to prevent or minimize a recurrence of the threat.
    * Network Members will dedicate every reasonable effort to persecute any conflict officially initiated by The Network.
    * The Network, as a whole, may only engage in acts of war or elevated conflict after a formal vote by the Council of representatives.
    * Individual Member Orgs are not required to obtain Network permission to independently initiate hostilities or conflicts with other groups, but they will not receive the full support of The Network when doing so. The obligation for defense and military aid does not apply to conflicts that one or more Member Orgs started without the official approval of The Network as a whole. Network Members may commit efforts to support other Members who initiate such conflict, or provide no support at all, as they see fit.
    * Member Orgs should carefully weigh the risk of large conflict and its impact on The Network when making independent decisions. Member Orgs that repeatedly engage in actions that endanger The Network, Network Members, or reflect poorly on The Network as a whole may be subject to censure, or in extreme cases, ejection from The Network.
  * **Disaster Relief** - In the event of a catastrophic loss of resources (e.g., a raid that destroys a major base), a Member Org may request emergency supplies.
    * The Network will allocate resources to maintain a relief pool to be set aside to be drawn upon in the event of a major disaster affecting one or more Member Orgs.
    * Drawing on the relief pool may be supplemented by any central Network bank or other resource pools, and donations of time and material from other Member Orgs.
    * If necessary, any efforts and distribution of resources will be coordinated by the Network Council, or an individual or individuals appointed by the Council in each case to manage the disaster relief on their behalf.
  * **General Support** - Member Orgs agree to provide general assistance, as they are reasonably able to support, to each other on a day-to-day basis.
    
3.2 **Economic Partnerships**
  * **Favored Client Status** - All Members may trade any in-game commodity or resource unless explicitly prohibited by CIG’s Terms of Service, EULA, or any other Real-Life laws.
    * Production of “craftable” materials and components for other Network Members shall be supplied to Network Members at not more than 50% above production cost, or 50% below market rate, whichever is higher.
    * Supply of harvestable materials and components shall be at or below the market rate, unless the purchasing party voluntarily agrees to pay more.
  * **Shared Stockpiles** - Each Member may contribute a voluntary percentage of their surplus to a common supply depot that can be drawn upon by any Member with a valid request.
    * These stockpiles are to establish rainy-day funds and initial-capital resources for Members to utilize.
    * Requests shall be approved by the Network Council, or by an individual or group appointed by the Council to manage these stockpiles in their stead.
  * **Joint Projects** - The Network may establish Base-Sharing Agreements, Mining/Harvesting Coalitions, or Infrastructure Networks (e.g., shared transport routes).
    * Member Orgs agree to contribute to the construction of joint bases and depots shared by The Network. Exact contributions will be determined at the time of project approval.
    * Member Orgs are not required to provide joint access to all of their owned assets, bases, etc., but individual Member Orgs are encouraged to establish base and resource-sharing agreements with each other.
    * Member Orgs may be required to establish some joint base access to The Network as a whole. Exact requirements shall be evaluated by the Council based on in-game mechanics, and logistical and strategic concerns, and passed by Council Resolution.
  * **Central Bank** - The Network will maintain a Central Bank system that maintains a Network Treasury that manages the Common Supply Depot, Central Currency Bank, & Network Stockpiles.
    * The administration of this central bank/treasury shall be done by the Network Council, or an individual or group appointed to manage it in the Council’s stead.
      
3.3. **Community Growth Support**
  * **Event Participation** - Member Orgs are expected to participate in Network Level Events & Member Org Hosted Events when able.
    * Participation in events is not mandatory, but participation in Network events and contributions to The Network will be factors evaluated when considering the approval of requests for the use of Network resources.
  * **Network Referrals** - Members should prefer other Member Orgs when giving referrals for goods/services/etc. to outside entities. I.E. a mercenary Member Org should refer a player looking to join a mining org to an industrial Member Org, or an industrial Member Org should refer another industrial org to a mercenary Member Org for security contracting, etc.
  * **Player Relocation** - While Member Orgs should not seek to snipe players from other Member Orgs, players in Network Member Orgs may freely switch Orgs if another Member Org suits their interests/personality/playstyle/etc. better, provided they meet any entry and acceptance requirements of the other Member Org.
    * The intention is to ensure players find a home within The Network that best fits their interests and enjoyment of the game and the larger community.
    * A player that is not happy with the Org they are in is unlikely to stay within that Org. By allowing them to freely switch to another Org within The Network that better fits them, they are still retained within the larger Network community, better maintaining the population of The Network as a whole, and reducing the chances of them being cast into the wind where they might join another group that opposes The Network.
